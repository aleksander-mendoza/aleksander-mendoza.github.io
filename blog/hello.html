<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>This is the very first post on my nerd blog. May I introduce myself a bit.</p>

<ul>
<li>My name is Aleksander Mendoza</li>
<li>I've been coding ever since I was 14 and I've got quite a bit to tell you. </li>
<li>My greatest passion is theoretical computer science and machine learning. I will be mostly focusing on these 2 subjects but there will be more, including language tutorials, good programming advices, library how-to's and a bit of business related stuff.</li>
<li>since 2017 I'm a student at university in Pozna≈Ñ.</li>
<li>since 2018 I work at Samsung's Bixby dev team. (hopefully one day I will find a serious AI-related job but this one is not bad for 1st grade student, huh)</li>
</ul>

<h5>How I make this blog</h5>

<p>I thought for a long time about using tumblr/medium or any other blogging platform. I even tried it for a bit but in the end I decided to do something completely different! <br />
<strong>Markdown</strong>! <br />
This whole blog will be written in markdown. Why? Because this way I am:</p>

<ul>
<li>100% independent. Even if one day tumblr or medium explodes, I won't lose anything. I can keep everything on my own computer and upload it wherever I want. Isn't it great?</li>
<li>a terrible designer. I can't design a single thing and if you were ever to read my HTML you would be greeted with just one large txt file wrapped in \<html> tags. Markdown takes care of it and it's for the better.</li>
</ul>

<p>On top of that, it will be easy for me to host this blog on github which is great for making and keeping track of changes. I might even get pull requests from my readers!</p>

<p>If you want to contact me for any cool reason, here's my email:  aleksander.mendoza.drosik@gmail.com
I am open to discussion in english, spanish, german, polish and might even kinda replay to you in broken Russian (speaking is much easier than writing cyrillics for me hehe)</p>
