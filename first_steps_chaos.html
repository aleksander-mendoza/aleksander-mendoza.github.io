and other similar fields of mathematics. If you don't know about them, here are
a few great resources to learn the fundamentals</p>

<p>On this website I try to focus on more advanced topics.</p>

<p>Most of real-life problems cannot be easily solved using mathematics
and we need to resort to numerical integration. 
For example you might want to simulate physics of rigid and soft bodies, 
flow of liquid and gas or motion of celestial bodies.
Once you write the appropriate algorithm, you probably want to see the results in
some meaningful way, right? You will likely need to know a bit of computer graphics to
produce 3D scenes. You might also want to use the power of modern GPUs
to accelerate the computations.</p>
