<p>If you like the format of these tutorials, you might be wondering 
which tool I used. What you see is <i>tutorial-markdown</i>. It's a tool
developed by me, specifically to allow me for rapid and easy writing of
tutorials. If you're interested in getting access to it, contact me here (TODO: add contact forms)</p>

<p>All standard features of markdown are the same.
You can use</p>

<p>However, it has many extra options.</p>


<pre><code class="language-plaintext">embedd `code` inside a text pargraph or create a
```
code
block
```

add an expandable block
~~~ Click here to expand
with *its* **own** markdown inside  
```
and even 
code block
```
~~~

You can write LaTeX equations with 
$1 + alpha^beta = Omega_3$ and they will be preprendered (works much faster than MathJax and has a lot more options than KaTeX)

Embed state-graphs using graphviz (TODO)

Quickly create diagrams and visual explanations using a very
simple geometry-description language (TODO) 

Generate a slide-show (TODO)

Generate animated videos by combining the geometry-description language
together with slide-show description language. You can even add voice
generated by neural-network TTS system. (TODO)

Embed browser-based interpreters of various programming languages
(Python, Bash, C, JavaScript ...)

Add a video using &gt;[video](/assets/ast_funny.mp4)

Add interactive quizes, tests and questions with

--- questions 
@Q: choice
This is a single-choice questions
@A: wrong
This is a wrong answer
@E:

@A: correct

@E:

@Q: multi-choice
This is a multi-choice question
@A: correct
Is this correct?
@E:
Explanation
@A: correct
This might be correct too (without explanation)
@Q: text
here is a text-based question. What&#x27;s your favourite fruit?
@A: correct 
apple|banana
@E:
You liked apple or banana! Nice
@A: wrong 
(sea)?horse)
@E:
You liked seahorse or a horse! It&#x27;s not a fruit

--- markdown

You need to use `--- markdown` to exit questions mode and switch back to markdown mode.
There are many different modes. Another one is buttons! Notice that buttons are not just 
normal links. *tutorial-markdown* treats them specially. It is able to build
dependency graphs between different posts and then assemble them into a
graph that looks like a skill-tree.

--- buttons 
name_of_some_post:Text on the button
name_of_another_post:Don&#x27;t click! Those posts don&#x27;t actually exist
