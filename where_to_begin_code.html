<p>When I first started programming, the most important question on my mind was</p>

<h2>Which programming language should I learn first?</h2>

<p>Now, after years of experience, I know that there are two good advices that could be
given. You will choose one of them depending on your goals and aspirations. The first one is pragmatic.</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose the one language that best suits your circumstances and really stick to it, until you learn it well. For example, if your aspiration is to create a mod for your favourite game, you should choose the same language that the game was originally written in. If your goal is to pass some course at your school, the language is forced upon you. If you want to learn programming but are afraid of deep waters and prefer to start with something easy, go with Python. To create websites you will need JavaScript. To write your own game you might want to use C# and Unity. To become a machine learning expert, Python or R is the weay to go. In order to build robots you will need C and assembler. </li>
</ul>

<p>The second one is the only correct advice in the long term.</p>

<ul>
<li>Don't learn any programming language. Learn programming concepts and different ways of thinking about problems. You could learn them once and for all and then use this experience quickly pick up any specific programming language in the matter of days or hours. </li>
</ul>

<p>In this tutorial I will follow the second advice. If you want to follow the first one, there is pleothora of great and free resources on the internet:</p>
