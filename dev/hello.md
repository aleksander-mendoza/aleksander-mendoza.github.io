# Hello
This is the very first post on my nerd blog. May I introduce myself a bit.

- My name is Aleksander Mendoza
- I've been coding ever since I was 14 and I've got quite a bit to tell you. 
- My greatest passion is theoretical computer science and machine learning. I will be mostly focusing on these 2 subjects but there will be more, including language tutorials, good programming advices, library how-to's and a bit of business related stuff.
- since 2017 I'm a student at university in Pozna≈Ñ.
- since 2018 I work at Samsung's Bixby dev team. (hopefully one day I will find a serious AI-related job but this one is not bad for 1st grade student, huh)

##### How I make this blog

I thought for a long time about using tumblr/medium or any other blogging platform. I even tried it for a bit but in the end I decided to do something completely different!  
**Markdown**!  
This whole blog will be written in markdown. Why? Because this way I am:

* 100% independent. Even if one day tumblr or medium explodes, I won't lose anything. I can keep everything on my own computer and upload it wherever I want. Isn't it great?
* a terrible designer. I can't design a single thing and if you were ever to read my HTML you would be greeted with just one large txt file wrapped in \<html> tags. Markdown takes care of it and it's for the better.

On top of that, it will be easy for me to host this blog on github which is great for making and keeping track of changes. I might even get pull requests from my readers!

If you want to contact me for any cool reason, here's my email:  aleksander.mendoza.drosik@gmail.com
I am open to discussion in english, spanish, german, polish and might even kinda replay to you in broken Russian (speaking is much easier than writing cyrillics for me hehe)
