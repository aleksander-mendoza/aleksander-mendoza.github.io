Hi! My name's Aleksander Mendoza-Drosik and I am a computer science student. Formal methods have been my main interest for a long time. I created this blog to promote and educate people about formal verification. It's meant to be easily accessible even to amateur programmers. However, I will make more advanced posts too!

Here is my email if you want to get in touch:
aleksander.mendoza.drosik@gmail.com

I am always very open to topic suggestions, collaborations, etc. Usually I try to focus on 

- computability theory, 
- complexity theory, 
- automata and formal languages, 
- logic and fondations of mathematics,
- automated theorem proving / proof assistans,
- theory and semantics of programming languages / compiler design
- philosophy of science and education

You can even email me if you find any mistake on my blog (such feedback is always appreciated).
