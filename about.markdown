Hi! My name's Aleksander Mendoza-Drosik and I am a computer science student. Formal methods have been my main interest for a long time. I created this blog to promote and educate people about formal verification. Its meant to be easily accessible even to amateur programmers. However, I will make more advanced posts too!

Here is my email if you want to get in touch:
